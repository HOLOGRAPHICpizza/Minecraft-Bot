This is a project to create a bot for minecraft using nevercast's code for a simple bot as a basis for the protocol management and adding an AI. This will require adding many capabilities to the original code, such as movement, pathfinding, block breaking, crafting and a prioritising AI as an end goal.
TODO
1) update to 1.8.1 protocol
2) add movement system
3) add movement pathfinding
4) add block breaking
5) make simple bot that chops down trees and plants saplings in their place
6) ability to craft tools
7) add ability to accept commands over chat
8) add simple weighting of options and ideas of effects based upon time, eg having tools making chopping down trees faster
9) prioritisation of tasks based upon more sophisticated criteria such as availability of materials, safety of areas based upon time etc.

This tool is not intended for greifing, it is intended as an amusement and a curiosity.
